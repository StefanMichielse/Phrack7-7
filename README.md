# Phrack 7-7
This repository is related to a Phrack post, written a long time ago. For my blog-posts I
replayed the issues mentioned in the post. As we will see we have to rewrite the C file.

This because probably on purpose, the code displayed in the Phrack post is not working. Potentially the original
author didn't want that everyone could use his code to harm other systems. Apparently in the time 
that the Phrack magazine was written, another hacker was active.

I do understand the point of the author, I updated the code. Of course you are only allowed to use 
this code on a system which you own or a system with explicit permissions on paper about using this code or security
testing. In case you decide to use this repository to hack other systems, you are responsible
